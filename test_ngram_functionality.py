    A probabilistic neural network (PNN) [1] is a feedforward neural network, which is widely used in classification and pattern recognition problems.
    In the PNN algorithm, the parent probability distribution function (PDF) of each class is approximated by a Parzen window and a non-parametric function.
    Then, using PDF of each class, the class probability of a new input data is estimated and Bayesâ€™ rule is then employed to allocate the class with highest posterior probability to new input data.
    By this method, the probability of mis-classification is minimized.[2] This type of artificial neural network (ANN) was derived from the Bayesian network[3] and a statistical algorithm called Kernel Fisher discriminant analysis.[4] 
    It was introduced by D.F. Specht in 1966.[5][6] In a PNN, the operations are organized into a multilayered feedforward network with four layers:
